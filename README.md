## How To Use The App
You can select one of the prewritten tunes from a drop-down list, or you can create your own tabs for any tune you like.

Notes can be written both in English (c d e...) and Ukrainian (до ре мі...), as well as using numbers (1 2 3...).
Use # after a note to indicate sharp, and +, ++, or uppercase letters to indicate upper octaves. 
Spaces and newlines can be used for grouping. Add headings, subheadings and comments as you like. 
You can also choose the key of the sopilka while creating tabs for your own tune: soprano C or alto F.
